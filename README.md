# Plexrequests.net-CSS
CSS Modification for the Plexrequests.net Webinterface

Since I would like to make Plexrequets look like my Plex Mediacenter, I decided to teak the Bootstrap and the custom.min css to look like it. Feel free to download it and change it to suit your needs.

**Install:**

Please download both files **bootstrap.css** and **custom.min.css** and replace with the ones located at:

`/opt/plexrequests/Release/Content`
