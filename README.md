# Plexrequests.net-CSS
CSS Modification for the Plexrequests.net

Since I would like to Plexrequets to look like my Plex Mediacenter, I decided to teak the Bootstrap css to look like it. Feel free to download it and change it to suit your needs.

**Install:**

Please download both files bootstrap.css and custom.min.css and replace with the ones located at:

`/opt/plexrequests/Release/Content`

These are some Screenshots:
